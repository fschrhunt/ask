# Packages

A package is a git repository shaped like `~/.ask`: any of `agents/`, `hooks/` and `commands/`.
Packages are how people share what they built for ask and keep it up to date, without forking ask
or copying files by hand.

├── agents/     my-cli
├── hooks/      verify
└── commands/   review
```

## Official agents

ask comes with an official package for each common coding agent CLI, in
[`packages/`](../packages) of its repository and built into the binary. A bare name installs one,
without the network:

```sh
ask install claude                # Claude Code
ask install codex opencode        # Codex and Opencode
ask install copilot gemini
ask install pi e cursor aider amp qwen kimi
ask install goose cline kilo continue openhands vibe
```

```text
ask: installed ask/packages/claude: agents: claude
ask: claude is ready: 4 models, see ask models
```

An installed official package always matches the ask that runs it: when ask updates, its
packages update with it. `ask remove claude` removes one.

After installing, ask checks each agent the package brings by asking it for its models. An agent
that can't run says why, like a CLI that isn't installed, and `ask install` exits 1:

```text
ask: codex is not ready: Codex not found: install it from https://developers.openai.com/codex, or set ASK_CODEX_BIN to its path
```

An adapter is not a promise that every harness has the same features. Read-only runs must be
enforced by tool restrictions or a sandbox, not just by instructions to the model. An adapter
that cannot enforce them refuses a read run rather than silently granting writes. Native session
titles, continuation, token counts and cost reporting depend on the harness; consult
`ask docs NAME` before relying on them. ask validates JSON answers itself when the harness has no
native schema flag.

### Harness capabilities

All packages are built into ask; `ask install NAME` connects an already installed CLI.
`ask docs NAME` gives setup instructions, research sources and detailed limits.

| Agent | Access | Continue | Native title | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude | Read/write | Yes | Yes | Live tokens, final cost |
| codex | Read/write | Yes | Best-effort | Live tokens |
| opencode | Read/write | Yes | Yes | Live tokens/cost |
| copilot | Read/write | Yes | New sessions | Final tokens |
| gemini | Read/write¹ | Yes | No | Final tokens |
| pi | Read/write | Yes | Yes | Live tokens/cost |
| e | Read/write | Yes | Yes | Live tokens, final cost |
| cursor | Write only | Yes | No | None |
| aider | Write only | No | No | Final tokens/cost |
| amp | Write only | Same mode | New threads | Live tokens |
| qwen | Write only | Yes | No | Tokens |
| kimi | Read/write | Same access | No | None |
| goose | Write only | Yes | New sessions² | New-run totals only |
| cline | Write only | Yes | No | None |
| kilo | Read/write | Yes | Yes | Live tokens/cost |
| continue | Write only | No | No | None |
| openhands | Write only | Yes | No | None |
| vibe | Write only | Yes | No | Native price cap, no usage |

¹ Gemini refuses read runs when system policies prevent applying/verifying ask's restrictive
admin policy. Trusted folders remain an upstream prerequisite.

² Goose appends a unique suffix to the supplied title because it resumes sessions by name.
Its follow-up usage is omitted rather than counting earlier turns again.

No usage means cost limits cannot be measured by ask. Final-only cost can produce an overspend
note but cannot stop a turn midway. Vibe's native price cap depends on the configured model
pricing. Read access is a model-tool boundary unless the harness provides an OS sandbox; it
does not make an installed CLI or plugin untrusted-code-safe.

Several CLIs have no reliable machine-readable model list. Those adapters intentionally list
no models; use the harness's own model listing and `ask models NAME:ID --enable` to add exact
IDs. Continue needs `ASK_CONTINUE_CONFIG` (a JSON-encoded config), Vibe needs `VIBE_MODELS`,
and Qwen reads its native `modelProviders` settings. e currently requires building upstream from
source; it never changes directory-trust settings for you.

### Choosing harnesses

The October 2026 expansion surveyed Copilot, Gemini CLI, Pi, Cursor CLI, Aider, Goose, Cline,
Kilo, Amp, Continue, OpenHands, Amazon Q/Kiro, Mistral Vibe, Qwen Code and Kimi Code;
e was included by request.
Selection considers adoption signals and a usable noninteractive CLI, not just whether an IDE
extension can read ask's skill.

For context, the [npm downloads API](https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/last-week/@github/copilot)
reported about 1.72 million weekly downloads for Copilot, 870 thousand for Pi's former
`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` package, 453 thousand for Gemini CLI, 33 thousand for Kilo and
27 thousand for Amp for September 28–October 4, 2026. GitHub repositories also show substantial
interest in Aider, Goose, Cline, Continue and OpenHands. Downloads and repository stars are
imperfect adoption proxies, not counts of active CLI users; IDE/platform popularity alone does
not establish that a CLI is mature. e is a requested development-stage integration, not a claim
of widespread adoption.

**Deferred: Amazon Q / Kiro.** Kiro has a real
[headless CLI](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/headless/) with model selection and JSON streaming,
but its published docs do not define the event fields needed to separate answers from tool
output and identify failed/interrupted runs. The retired
[Amazon Q CLI source](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli) has a different argument and
output contract and cannot establish Kiro's wire format. No placeholder adapter is installed;
support needs a verified success/tool/failure stream fixture first. This is a contract-verification
gap, not a claim that Kiro lacks headless mode.

## Install, update, remove

```sh
ask install team/tools                   # OWNER/REPO on GitHub
ask install https://gitlab.com/team/tools.git
ask install ~/code/my-ask-tools          # a local repository, while you work on it
ask install                              # update every installed package
ask packages                             # what is installed, and what each offers
ask remove tools
```

```text
ask/packages/claude         agents: claude
github.com/team/tools       agents: my-cli · commands: review · hooks: verify
```

`ask install` clones into `~/.ask/packages/HOST/OWNER/REPO`, and updating pulls fast-forward only;
official packages go to `~/.ask/packages/ask/packages/NAME`. Nothing runs at install time except
the readiness check: no scripts, no prompts. A bare NAME always means an official package and
`OWNER/REPO` always means GitHub, whatever folders are here; name a local repository by a path
such as `./tools`, `../team/tools` or `~/code/tools`.
Installing a source where another one is already installed, like a second local `team/tools`,
fails: remove the first.

Your own agent can be a package too: put it in `agents/` of a repository and
`ask install you/your-agents`.

## Which one runs

ask looks for an agent, hook or command in `~/.ask` first, then in each package in path order. The
first one with the name wins, so **yours always win**: to change something a package offers, put
your own of the same name in `~/.ask`, and your package updates still apply to everything else.

A package's executables run with your permissions, like any software you install. Install packages
from people you trust, and read what they do.
