# Releases

A release is a `v*` tag on main. Everything after the tag is automatic.

## Cutting one

From an up-to-date main checkout:

```sh
scripts/release.sh v0.2.0    # opens a PR naming CHANGELOG.md's Unreleased section v0.2.0
scripts/release.sh v0.2.0    # after merging it: checks CI passed on main, then tags
```

## What the tag runs

`.github/workflows/release.yml`, in order:

1. **check**: the tag is on main and `CHANGELOG.md` has its section; `./x check` and `./x audit`.
2. **release**: archives for macOS and Linux (arm64 and amd64) with checksums and build
   provenance; the GitHub release, with the changelog section as its notes.
3. **formula**: regenerates `ask.rb` (`scripts/formula.sh`) for the release and pushes it to main.
4. **install**: a real `install.sh` install of the release on both systems.

When the run record format changed, pin a record from the release in `test/fixtures/run-vX.Y.Z/`.

## Who can write to main

Only the `formula` job. It runs in the `release` environment, which only `v*` tags can use, and
pushes with that environment's `RELEASE_DEPLOY_KEY` secret: a deploy key explicitly
allowed to update main under its protection policy. Nothing else in the repository
can push to main.

Setting it up, or replacing the key, takes an admin of the repository:

1. Create the `release` environment, limited to tags matching `v*`.
2. Make a key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f key` in a temporary folder.
3. Add `key.pub` as a deploy key with write access, and `key` as the environment's
   `RELEASE_DEPLOY_KEY` secret; then delete both files.
4. Allow the deploy key to update main under its protection policy.

## Where people get it

- `curl -fsSL https://fschrhunt.com/ask/install.sh | sh`: `install.sh` from main, which downloads
  the latest release and checks its checksum.
- `brew install`: from `ask.rb` at the top of this repository, which Homebrew reads as a tap.
- `go install github.com/fschrhunt/ask/cmd/ask@latest`.
- `ask update`, for a direct install.
