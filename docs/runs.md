# Runs

Every time ask starts agents, that is a run. ask names it after the first meaningful words of its
prompt, and status lines start with the name:

```text
ask login-test-fail · started · Sonnet 5.5 · read · ~/code/app
ask login-test-fail · ok · Sonnet 5.5 · 14.2s · 31.0k in · 812 out · $0.09
```

`RUN` in commands is a placeholder for that name or the run's id. Use the name printed by your
run rather than assuming an example's name matches. A name stays apart from earlier runs with
a number (`login-test-fail-2`), and a [name hook](hooks.md#naming-runs) can choose better ones. Every run
also has a fixed six-character id, like `k3f9a2`, that works wherever a name does.

A task in a batch is `RUN/TASK`, using the task's id (or its position, from 1):
`summarize-public-api-src/api`.

## Follow-ups

`--continue RUN` continues that run's agent conversation: the agent remembers what it read, said and did.

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 "Why does the login test fail?"
# ask login-test-fail · ok · Sonnet 5.5 · 48.0s · ...
ask --continue login-test-fail --write "Fix it, then run the test."
ask --continue login-test-fail --write "Now add a test for the expired-token case."
```

A follow-up is a new run that takes over the conversation's name, so the name always reaches the
latest turn. An earlier turn is still reachable by its id. A follow-up to a batch task starts its
own line of turns, named `RUN-TASK` (or `RUN-TASK-2` and so on when another run has that name).

A follow-up:

- runs where the first run ran: the same directory, or the same worktree if it kept one (a
  removed worktree is created again, under a new name if another run has taken that one).
  `--worktree` can't move a follow-up of a run in your checkout into a worktree; ask refuses it;
- keeps the model and access (`--read`/`--write`) unless you give new ones. The model may change within
  the same agent (`--continue login-test-fail --model claude:haiku-4.5`), but not to another agent;
- can continue a run that failed or timed out, so the agent can finish what it started;

A batch task can be a follow-up too, with `"continue": "RUN"` (see [Batches](batches.md)).

Continuing needs an agent that reports sessions (see [Agents](agents.md#sessions)) and a run that
has finished; ask says so when either is missing.

## Listing

```sh
ask runs          # the last 20 in this repository
ask runs -n 50
ask runs --all    # every run, wherever it worked
```

In a git repository, `ask runs` lists the runs that worked in it: in its main checkout or any of
its worktrees. Elsewhere it lists every run.

```text
RUN                       ID      STARTED  STATUS   MODEL       TIME   TASK
login-test-fail           b7x01q  2m ago   ok       Sonnet 5.5  2:31   ↪ login-test-fail Fix it, then run the test.
login-test-fail           k3f9a2  5m ago   ok       Sonnet 5.5  48.0s  Why does the login test fail?
summarize-public-api-src  p81c0d  24m ago  2/3 ok   3 tasks            Summarize the public API in src/.
find-bugs-internal-runs   x7d2e1  Sep 30   stopped  5 tasks            resume: ask batch --resume find-bugs-internal-runs
```

`running` means ask holds the run's operating system lock; `stopped` means it was interrupted
before every task finished. Interrupted tasks keep empty result slots, so they can be resumed.

## Showing a run again

```sh
ask show login-test-fail           # the latest turn's answer on stdout, its status line on stderr
ask show k3f9a2                    # an earlier turn, by id
ask show login-test-fail --json    # the whole result, with session, changes and worktree
ask show summarize-public-api-src  # a batch: all its results, as a JSON array
ask show summarize-public-api-src/api  # one task of a batch
```

Showing a whole batch prints its outcome count on stderr and exits 1 if any task failed; saved wall time is not recorded.

## Waiting for runs

`ask wait` blocks until the first currently running run finishes, then prints its answer the way
`ask show` does. It takes no names or options and watches only runs active when waiting begins.
Start runs in the background, keep working, and collect whichever answer arrives first. Wait
until their started lines appear before calling `ask wait`; shell background jobs may not have
created their run records yet:

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 "Why does the login test fail?" &
ask --model codex:gpt-6.1-sol "Review the session code for races." &
# Wait for both started lines on stderr before collecting an answer.
ask wait # first run to finish
```

If no run is active, it prints `ask: no runs are running` and exits 0. A run that was stopped before
finishing exits 1 with how to continue it.

## Stopping a run

`ask stop RUN` stops a run going in another terminal or in the background, and every agent it
started. It waits up to 10 seconds for them to exit, and fails if ask is still running then.

```sh
ask stop login-test-fail
```

A stopped batch can be resumed with `ask batch --resume RUN`, which reruns only the tasks that did
not finish ok.

## Cleaning up

Write runs keep their worktree and branch when they changed something, so you can review and
merge it; finished run records stay too. `ask clean` removes what is no longer needed:

```sh
ask clean               # shows the plan, then asks
ask clean --dry-run     # only shows it
ask clean --yes         # for scripts
ask clean --days 7      # runs older than a week (default 30)
```

```text
Worktrees
  remove  ~/.ask/worktrees/add-rate-limiting-login  ask/add-rate-limiting-login · merged into origin/main
  keep    ~/.ask/worktrees/fix-session-race         ask/fix-session-race · not merged into origin/main
Runs
  remove  14 runs older than 30 days
```

A worktree goes once it has no uncommitted changes and every file its branch changed matches the
main branch (origin's default, `main` or `master`), as after a merge or a squash merge, or when it
changed nothing; its branch goes with it. Anything else stays. Run records go when they are older
than `--days`, not running, and hold no worktree that stays.

## Where runs live

Each run is a folder in `~/.ask/runs/` (or `$ASK_HOME/runs/`), named by its start time, id and
name (runs from before names have none):

```text
~/.ask/runs/20261001T140912345-k3f9a2-login-test-fail/
├── tasks.json     the tasks, as they were given
├── results.json   the results so far, rewritten whole after each task
└── lock           held with an operating system lock while ask runs the run; the kernel names its pid
```

ask creates new run directories with mode 0700 and records with mode 0600. Deleting a finished
run's folder removes its saved answers and ability to continue it. Use
`ask clean` to account for kept worktrees before removing records.

Hosts can name a background run with `ask title --command STRING --description TEXT`; see
[Hosts](hosts.md) for title forms and agent-session naming.
