# Settings

`ask settings` is where you change ask: your agents and their models, your defaults, where
worktrees go, and what the apps you work in know about ask.

## In a terminal

```text
ask settings  ~/.ask

What do you want to change?
› Agents           claude, codex, opencode
  Defaults         claude:sonnet-5.5 · no cost limit · edited
  Worktrees        ~/code/worktrees/ask-{name}
  Apps             ask skill in 5 of 5 apps · task titles on
  Review and save  1 change
  Done
  ↑↓ move · type to filter · enter select
```

Nothing is written while you edit: what you change is marked `edited`, and **Review and save**
shows exactly what will change, file by file, before it asks:

```text
~/.ask/settings.json  +1 -1
  "timeout": 900
  "timeout": 1800

1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

Save these changes?
  Y/n · enter to confirm
```

Removed lines sit on a red band and added ones on a green band, under a bar naming each file
with its counts. Leaving with unsaved changes asks whether to
save them, and Ctrl-C discards them.

Prompts use an inline Bubble Tea interface with bold primary text and muted hints, using your
terminal's background and foreground. Lists adapt to terminal size. Text fields support left/right,
Home/End, deletion and bracketed paste; pasted newlines become spaces rather than submitting.
`NO_COLOR` disables styling. Completed answers remain in terminal scrollback.

- **Agents**: each agent: install or remove an official one, which of its models are on, and
  their cost limits. `ask settings NAME` opens one directly, like `ask settings opencode`.
- **Defaults**: the model when you don't give `-m`, the cost limit, the timeout and batch jobs.
- **Worktrees**: where `--worktree` works, and its branch name.
- **Apps**: the ask skill for each app that reads skills, and task titles in Claude Code.

## From scripts and agents

```sh
ask settings get                       # every setting, defaults marked
ask settings get model
ask settings get --json                # the values that apply
ask settings set max_cost 2            # shows what changes, then saves
ask settings set worktrees '~/code/worktrees/ask-{name}' --dry-run
ask settings unset model               # back to the default
ask settings set hook on
ask settings set skills all
```

`set` and `unset` print the same review on stderr; `--dry-run` stops there. Without a terminal,
`ask settings` prints `get`, and `ask settings NAME` prints that agent's models with on or off.

## settings.json

Your defaults are in `~/.ask/settings.json` (or `$ASK_HOME/settings.json`). Every key is optional;
without the file, ask uses the built-in defaults below.

```json
{
  "model": "claude:sonnet-5.5",
  "timeout": 1800,
  "max_cost": 2,
  "jobs": 6,
  "worktrees": "~/code/worktrees/ask-{name}",
  "branches": "ask/{name}"
}
```

| Key | What it sets | Built in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | The model when neither `-m`, a batch task, nor a follow-up gives one | none: `-m` is required |
| `timeout` | Seconds a task may run, unless `-t` or the task says otherwise | `900` |
| `jobs` | Batch tasks at once, unless `-j` says otherwise | `4` |
| `max_cost` | Dollars a task may spend before ask stops it, unless `--max-cost` or the model's own limit in [models.json](models.md#modelsjson) says otherwise; `0` for none (see [Cost limits](usage.md#cost-limits)) | none |
| `worktrees` | Where `--worktree` puts a run's worktree: an absolute or `~` path whose last part holds `{name}` once | `~/.ask/worktrees/{name}` |
| `branches` | The branch of a run's worktree, holding `{name}` once | `ask/{name}` |

`{name}` is the run's name, like `add-rate-limiting-login`, or `NAME-POSITION-TASK` for a batch
task. With the example above, `ask --write --worktree "Add rate limiting to login"` works in
`~/code/worktrees/ask-add-rate-limiting-login` on branch `ask/add-rate-limiting-login`.

`ask settings set` also takes `hook` (`on` or `off`) and `skills` (`claude-code`, `codex`,
`opencode`, `cursor`, `pi` or `all`), which live in those apps' own files. An unknown key or a
value of the wrong kind is an error that names the key, so a typo never silently does nothing.
Existing records keep their values. A new follow-up inherits the recorded model and access,
and finds its worktree where the current `worktrees` setting puts it; keep that setting stable
while continuing work in a kept worktree.
