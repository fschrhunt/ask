# Usage

```sh
ask --model MODEL [options] PROMPT
```

`ask help` is a compact reference with the models installed here. `ask help batch`,
`ask help hooks` and `ask help agents` describe their contracts.

Choose `MODEL` from `ask models`. Every run uses an explicit model: from `--model`, a follow-up, or
your default [setting](settings.md). The examples below use particular agents and models;
replace them with ids available in your installation. `RUN` is a name or id printed by ask
(see [Runs](runs.md)).

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 "Where is the retry logic, and what are its limits?"
ask --model codex:gpt-6.1-sol#high "Review the last commit for bugs."
```

## The prompt

Give it as arguments, or on stdin with `-` or no prompt at all. Words after `--` are always the
prompt, even ones that look like options:

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 "Summarize src/"
git diff | ask --model codex:gpt-6.1-sol -
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 < task.md
```

`--title TEXT` replaces the prompt text in the agent's session title, without changing the task:

```sh
ask --model codex:gpt-6.1-sol --title "Review login" "Inspect the login flow for races."
```

Short forms `-m`, `-w`, `-c`, `-C` and `-t` remain supported. `--title` is long-only;
`-t` means timeout.

## Read or write

| Option | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `--read`, `-r` | Read only. The default. |
| `--write`, `-w` | Read and write: the agent may edit files and run commands, as you. |

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 "Which functions have no tests?"                 # read
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 --write "Add tests for parseFlags, then run them" # write
```

ask passes your prompt to the agent as you wrote it, with the access in `ASK_ACCESS`. The agent
enforces read-only in its CLI's own way, and may add its own guidance for read runs, like
"search and read the files before answering"; see [Agents](agents.md#read-only). With the official
agents, a read run on Claude Code or Opencode can only read and search files, and runs no shell
commands at all, not even `git log`; one on Codex may run commands in Codex's read-only sandbox.

Running tests or builds writes files, so it needs `--write`. In a batch or bench, an explicit `--read` is a
ceiling: a task with `"write": true` is refused, not run with write access.

## What a write run changed

When a write run's directory is in a git repository, ask compares the repository before and after
and reports what the run changed: in the status line, and in full with `ask show RUN --json`.

```text
ask fix-parser-bugs · ok · Sonnet 5.5 · 41.2s · 3 files changed, 1 commit · 52.1k in · 2.0k out · $0.31
```

```json
"changes": [
  { "path": "src/parser.js", "change": "modified" },
  { "path": "test/parser.test.js", "change": "added" }
],
"commits": 1
```

File mode changes and symbolic links are included. Files that were already modified before the run are reported only if the run changed them again,
so your own uncommitted work never shows up as the agent's.

## Working in a worktree

`--worktree` (with `--write`) gives the run its own git worktree and branch, so several write runs
can work in separate checkouts in parallel:

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 --write --worktree --directory ~/code/app "Add rate limiting to the login route."
```

```text
ask add-rate-limiting-login · started · Sonnet 5.5 · write · worktree ~/.ask/worktrees/add-rate-limiting-login
ask add-rate-limiting-login · ok · Sonnet 5.5 · 3:05 · 4 files changed · branch ask/add-rate-limiting-login · 120.4k in · 6.2k out
```

The worktree starts from the repository's `HEAD`, at `~/.ask/worktrees/RUN`, on branch `ask/RUN`
(`RUN-2` and so on if another run's worktree has that name, so parallel runs never share one).
The `worktrees` and `branches` [settings](settings.md) put them elsewhere, like
`~/code/worktrees/ask-RUN`.
If the run changed something, both are kept for you to review and merge:

```sh
git -C ~/.ask/worktrees/add-rate-limiting-login status --short
git -C ~/.ask/worktrees/add-rate-limiting-login diff HEAD
# After reviewing, commit any uncommitted edits in the worktree.
git -C ~/code/app diff HEAD...ask/add-rate-limiting-login
git -C ~/code/app merge ask/add-rate-limiting-login
git -C ~/code/app worktree remove ~/.ask/worktrees/add-rate-limiting-login
git -C ~/code/app branch -d ask/add-rate-limiting-login
```

Use the actual path and branch from the run's output. ask does not automatically commit the
agent's edits: merging a branch includes only committed changes. `diff HEAD` shows tracked
uncommitted edits; inspect untracked files listed by `status` too.

After all hook follow-ups, ask removes a worktree only when git reports it clean and its HEAD
still points to the starting commit. An idle follow-up keeps earlier work. A read-only follow-up
can use a kept worktree; recreating one requires write access. Uncommitted changes in your
checkout are not in the worktree; ask says so when it starts.

## Where the agent works

`--directory DIR` sets where the agent works (default: where you run ask). `--dir` and `-C` are aliases:

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 --directory ~/code/app "How does login work?"
```

## Time limit

`--timeout SECONDS` stops a run that takes too long (default 900, at most 2000000). `-t` is its short form. The run fails with `timed out`, and
everything the agent started is stopped.

```sh
ask --model codex:gpt-6.1-sol --write --timeout 3600 "Upgrade the project to Node 24 and fix what breaks."
```

## Cost limits

A cost limit stops a task that spends more than you meant to. It is off unless you set one:

```sh
ask settings set max_cost 2                       # every task: a $2 cost limit (the max_cost setting)
ask models claude:opus-5.5 --max-cost 10          # this model: its own limit, instead
ask --model claude:opus-5.5 --max-cost 25 --write "Port the parser to Rust."   # this run only
```

The run's own `--max-cost` wins, then the model's limit in models.json, then the setting; `0`
means no limit. A follow-up keeps a positive recorded limit unless you give it one. A prior
unlimited run has no limit to inherit, so the model's limit or your setting applies unless
you explicitly pass `--max-cost 0` again.
When a task passes its limit, the agent is stopped. If it has reported a session, you can
continue the conversation and decide whether it's worth more.

```text
ask port-parser-rust · failed · Opus 5.5 · 6:12 · 412.0k in · 9.1k out · $25.31 · stopped at the $25.00 cost limit; ask -c port-parser-rust continues it
```

How closely a limit holds depends on what the agent's CLI reports. Opencode reports cost after
every step, so ask stops it within a step of the limit. Claude Code reports cost only when it
ends, so its agent hands the limit to Claude Code's own budget, which stops after the model call
that passes it. Codex reports no cost, so limits don't apply to it; use `--timeout` to bound its time.

## JSON answers

`--json` requires the answer to be JSON. `--schema FILE` requires JSON that matches a JSON Schema.
ask tells the agent the format, strips a code fence if the agent adds one, and checks the answer
itself, whatever the agent. An agent whose CLI supports schemas natively can also enforce it
there, from `ASK_SCHEMA`.

```sh
cat > findings.json <<'EOF'
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "bugs": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "file": { "type": "string" },
          "line": { "type": "integer" },
          "problem": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["file", "problem"]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["bugs"]
}
EOF
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 --schema findings.json "Find bugs in src/parser.js" | jq '.bugs[].file'
```

ask honors boolean schemas (`false` rejects every answer) and checks `type`, `enum`, `const`, `properties`, `required`, `additionalProperties: false` and `items` (including `items: false`).
Other schema keywords are ignored by ask; an agent may enforce more. An
answer that is not JSON, or does not match, fails the run with the reason:

```text
ask find-bugs-src-parser · failed · Sonnet 5.5 · 12.3s · answer does not match the schema: $.bugs[0]: missing "file"
```

## Follow-ups

Every run gets a name from its prompt. Continue the same agent conversation with `--continue`; see
[Runs](runs.md).

```sh
ask --model claude:sonnet-5.5 "Why does the login test fail?"
ask --continue login-test-fail --write "Fix it."
```

## Output

- **stdout** has only the answer: text, or JSON under `--json`/`--schema`. It is safe to pipe.
- **stderr** in a pipe has a status line when the run starts and one when it ends. Each begins
  with the run's name. The first names the task after hooks, the second the model that ran, with the outcome, time,
  what changed and usage when the agent reports it.

```text
ask login-test-fail · started · Sonnet 5.5 · read · ~/code/app
ask login-test-fail · ok · Sonnet 5.5 · 14.2s · 31.0k in · 812 out · $0.09
```

- **Exit code**: 0 on success, 1 when the run failed, 2 when ask was called wrong (the message says
  what to fix; `ask help COMMAND` shows the options). Missing or malformed model specifications
  also show available models grouped by agent.

Stopping ask (Ctrl-C) stops the agent too.

On a terminal, stderr shows a spinner with the model name, read/write access, directory,
elapsed time and the tokens and cost so far, as the agent reports them (see
[Agents](agents.md#running-name)), then a final marked row. Hook notes and follow-ups appear beneath their task.
Batches show a header and task rows with queued, running, ok or failed state and reasons.
Rows fit the terminal width; very large batches show a count of hidden lines.
The frame finishes before answers print, so stdout may share the terminal. Ctrl-C stops agents,
leaves the stopped state visible and restores the cursor. `TERM=dumb` uses plain lines;
`NO_COLOR` disables colors while retaining live updates. Piped stderr has no ANSI or spinner.
