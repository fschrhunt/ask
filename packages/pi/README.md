# pi

The ask adapter for [Pi](https://pi.dev). Runs one JSON-mode turn with Node.js
built-ins only. The shell launcher requires Node.js 18+; the researched Pi 1.0.4
CLI itself requires Node.js 22.19+. Authenticate in Pi before using the adapter.

## Install and models

```sh
ask install pi
```

Pi has no machine-readable model catalog command, so `pi models` through this
adapter prints nothing. Add the exact `provider/model` IDs you use to ask's
`~/.ask/models.json`; consult upstream `pi --list-models` for available IDs.

```sh
ask -m pi:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 "Explain this project"
ask -w -m pi:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5#high "Fix the issue"
```

The provider and model ID are passed separately through `--provider` and `--model`.
Nested IDs such as `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` work. Supply an exact
ID: Pi's own model resolver also accepts fuzzy queries, which this adapter does
not expand or independently validate. Unqualified names and wildcard patterns
are rejected. `ASK_EFFORT` maps to `--thinking`: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`,
`high`, `xhigh`, or `max`; the selected Pi version/model decides which it supports.
Thinking suffixes in the model ID are rejected; use ask's `#effort` instead.

## Access

Read runs explicitly allow only `read,grep,find,ls`. Shell, edits, writes and
other tools are unavailable. This policy is reapplied on continuation.
`--no-extensions` prevents global, project, package and built-in extensions from
running or replacing tools. Skills, prompt templates and themes are also disabled
in both modes. Read runs set `PI_OFFLINE=1`: Pi otherwise resolves and may install
configured packages even with extensions disabled. Offline does not block model
API requests; it skips startup network work and missing-package installation.

Write runs enable `read,grep,find,ls,bash,edit,write`; they have unrestricted shell
access as the current user. There is no OS sandbox in either mode. Read-only is
a model tool boundary, not a filesystem sandbox: Pi still persists its session,
may migrate its global configuration,
and may cache/download search binaries. Read runs refuse a legacy `.pi/commands`
directory that Pi would rename to `.pi/prompts` at startup. Context files such as `AGENTS.md` remain
available. New read prompts also ask the model to ground its answer in files;
the actual restriction comes from the tool list and disabled extensions.

## Sessions, titles and usage

The JSON session header's ID is reported immediately. `ASK_SESSION` continues it
with `--session`, using Pi's session lookup. Pi stores the conversation in its own
session directory. `ASK_TITLE` maps to native `--name` on new and resumed sessions.
The researched CLI trims the name and rejects an empty value; it imposes no
explicit character cap. This is a session display label, not a terminal-window
title. Older Pi versions without `--name` are unsupported when a title is supplied.

Each completed assistant message adds usage once. Streaming usage updates report
the current message plus earlier messages; compaction usage is added when Pi
exposes `compaction_end.result.usage`. Input includes cache reads and writes,
`cached` counts cache reads, and output already includes reasoning tokens.
Cost uses Pi's estimate. Ask can stop at its cost limit after a report update,
so billing can exceed the limit before the next update. Missing usage stays absent.

Only the last completed assistant text reaches stdout. JSON-mode errors and
aborts fail even if Pi exits zero; a tool-only or empty turn fails. An answer cut
off at the output-token limit is marked partial. `ASK_SCHEMA` is not enforced
natively; ask supplies the JSON instruction and validates the answer. There is
no adapter step cap, image input, interactive extension UI or model alias mapping.

## Environment and tests

`ASK_PI_BIN` selects the CLI executable; otherwise it is found on PATH,
`~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`. `ASK_NODE` selects the
launcher's Node runtime; the launcher also searches the existing official
packages' Node installation locations. An invalid explicit CLI override fails
without falling back. Standard ask inputs are `ASK_MODEL`, `ASK_EFFORT`,
`ASK_ACCESS`, `ASK_SESSION`, `ASK_TITLE` and `ASK_REPORT`.

```sh
cd packages/pi && node --test
```

Tests drive `test/bin/pi`, with no network or real model calls.
