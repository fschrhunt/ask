# codex

The official ask agent for [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex).
It runs `codex exec` for ask, so `ask -m codex:gpt-6.1-sol "..."` hands a task to Codex.

## Install

```sh
ask install codex
ask models
```

Requires Codex, logged in, and Node.js 18 or newer. The agent finds both even when they are not on
ask's `PATH`: Codex in `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` or the Codex app; Node.js in Homebrew, `/usr/local/bin`, Volta,
nvm (the newest), fnm or `~/.local/bin`. Without one, `ask models` shows what to install.

Installing the ask package does not install its CLI, Node.js or credentials. `ask models`
checks model listing, not whether a task can authenticate and run.

## Models

`ask models` includes the models in Codex's own model cache (`~/.codex/models_cache.json`, or under
`$CODEX_HOME`), without review or reserved models, with Codex's display names (`gpt-6.1-sol` shows as GPT-6.1 Sol). Run
Codex once to fill the cache. Ids are Codex's own and match without regard to case. An effort
(`codex:gpt-6.1-sol#high`) is passed as `model_reasoning_effort`.

## Read and write

Both run in Codex's OS sandbox, never asking for approval:

- **Read runs** use the `read-only` sandbox: Codex may run any command, but nothing can write. The
  prompt starts with an instruction to answer from the files in the working directory and never
  guess.
- **Write runs** (`ask -w`) use `workspace-write` with network access, so installing dependencies
  and running tests work.

A `--schema` is passed as `--output-schema`, converted to the strict form OpenAI's structured
output requires: every object closed and every property required.

## Follow-ups

The thread id Codex announces first is reported to ask at once, so `ask -c RUN` runs
`codex exec resume` on it, with the same sandbox. A follow-up's prompt is passed as is.

## Usage

The agent rewrites ask's report as each Codex turn completes, so token counts show live. Codex
reports no cost. The report names the model by Codex's display name.

## Cost limits

The agent reports no cost, so ask cannot enforce a cost limit for Codex, regardless of how
you authenticate it. Use `-t` to bound how long a run may take.

## Environment

| Variable | |
| --- | --- |
| `ASK_CODEX_BIN` | The `codex` executable to run, instead of looking on `PATH` and in the usual places. |
| `ASK_NODE` | The Node.js executable to run the agent with. |
| `CODEX_HOME` | Codex's home, for its model cache; `~/.codex` by default. |

The agent also reads ask's contract variables: `ASK_MODEL`, `ASK_EFFORT`, `ASK_ACCESS`, `ASK_TITLE`,
`ASK_SCHEMA`, `ASK_SESSION` and `ASK_REPORT` (see [Agents](../../docs/agents.md)).

## Testing

```sh
cd packages/codex && node --test
```

The tests drive a fake `codex` in `test/bin`; they need no network or account. To try the real
thing by hand:

```sh
echo "say hi" | ASK_MODEL=gpt-6.1-sol ASK_ACCESS=read ASK_REPORT=/tmp/r.json \
  ~/.ask/packages/ask/packages/codex/agents/codex
cat /tmp/r.json
```
