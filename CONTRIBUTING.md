Smallness is the point: dependencies stay in terminal presentation, and the core knows nothing
about any particular agent.
A change that makes ask simpler is welcome; one that adds a moving part needs a strong reason.

You need Go 1.26 or newer, git, a POSIX shell, Node.js 18+ for the official agents' tests and
shellcheck for `./x shell`.

```sh
./x hooks     # once: gofmt and vet before each commit
./x check     # before a pull request; CI runs the same command
```

`./x` defaults to `check`: Go formatting and vet, Go tests, offline Baymax integration
checks, shellcheck and architectural guards. It does not rewrite sources. Network dependency
audits stay separate in `./x audit`. `./x --help` lists targets; `./x test` and `./x build`
forward Go arguments, for example `./x test ./test -run TestRuns`.

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): commands, where things live, conventions.
- [docs/contributing/architecture.md](docs/contributing/architecture.md): how a task runs, the
  packages, and the rules the layout keeps.
- [test/README.md](test/README.md): the tests, the fake agent, and which file covers what.
- [docs/contributing/releases.md](docs/contributing/releases.md): cutting a release.

A behavior change comes with one test for it, and a user-visible change with a line in
`CHANGELOG.md` and an update to `docs/`. Support for a coding agent belongs in its own agent, not
in ask (see `docs/agents.md`).

To report an issue, include your operating system, the command you ran, what you expected, and
what happened. Add the output of `ask --version`, `ask help`, and `ask setup --check`; redact
private paths, prompts and other sensitive details before sharing them.
